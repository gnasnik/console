  KS_DESCRIPTION:
    "Titan Container is a next-generation container computing platform built upon KubeSphere, comprising two core components: Edge Container and Data Center (DC) Container. Building on KubeSphere's robust container management capabilities, we implement blockchain technology to facilitate decentralized container orchestration and computational resource scheduling. Through innovative deployment of smart contracts, we achieve automated cross-node resource allocation and transparent settlement. The decentralized architecture ensures data privacy and system security, with all operations being traceable and immutable, thereby providing a secure and efficient one-stop solution for enterprise computing, AI training, and big data analytics.",
